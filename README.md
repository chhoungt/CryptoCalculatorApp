# CryptoCalculatorApp

Created with [Bunchhoung Tiv](https://github.com/chhoungt) and [Nhan Tran](https://github.com/kevintran1308).

A Crypto Calculator App that will give the user the ability to do live conversions from FIAT (USD, Euros) to Crypto (Bitcoin, Dogecoins, etc) and vice versa. This app was created for our Mobile App 1 class, and was meant for ourselves to learn Android Studio as well.

## Notes

App has only been tested on the Nexus 5; it may look improper on other devices. Number pad may have un-even lines between each button. Given the amount of time we had in class to create this app, I believe results still came out satisfactory.
